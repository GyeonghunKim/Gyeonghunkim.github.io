In this presentation, I suggested reinforcement learning based semiconductor 2DEG quantum dot gate autotuning method. 
- Implementation of GPU based simple single electron simulator
- Implementation of reinforcement learning environment with above simulator
- Training reinforcement learning agent with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, REINFORCE
